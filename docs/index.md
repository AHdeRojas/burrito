### A web tool for interactive visualization of the links between taxonomic composition and function in microbiome datasets

DNA sequencing technology has revolutionized our ability to describe the structure and function of diverse microbial communities. Metagenomic sequencing studies typically focus on two related but separate questions: 
1) which microbial taxa are present, and 2) what genetic functions are present? 
These functions can be present in all taxonomic groups, some subset, or only a single species. The high dimensional nature of these data presents challenges for visualization. 
A sample may have on the order of 1,000 different species, each with 1,000-5,000 genes (which can be grouped into a smaller set of functional categories), and a typical metagenomic study consists 
of 10-100 samples across different environments, disease states, or time points.

Burrito a visualization tool to facilitate exploration of microbiome datasets describing both taxonomy and function. Burrito can display the distributions of species abundances, 
the distributions of function abundances, and the contributions of each species to each function, and furthermore allows interactive comparisons between different samples.
