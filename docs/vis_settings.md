# Burrito Visualization Settings

### Color Scheme

The user can choose between two color scheme options: 

- The Hierarchical color scale colors the nodes of a subtree in the taxonomic or function hierarchy a shade of the parent node's color, 
which is ideal for exploring overall trends in broad categories. 

- The Random color scale instead assigns random colors to the nodes of the taxonomic and function hierarchies, 
which is better for comparing fine-scale differences across samples.
