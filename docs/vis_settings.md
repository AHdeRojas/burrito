# Burrito Visualization Settings

### Color Scheme

The user can choose between two color scheme options (13). 
First, the hierarchical color scale colors the nodes of a subtree in the taxonomic or function hierarchy a shade of the parent node's color, 
which is ideal for exploring overall trends in broad categories. 
Second, the random color scale instead assigns random colors to the nodes of the taxonomic and function hierarchies, 
which is better for comparing fine-scale differences across samples.
